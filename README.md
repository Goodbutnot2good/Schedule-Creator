# **Schedule-Creator**

## ABOUT

This project is written in Python with the help of the [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) library and python 3.0's built in [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) library. The goal of this project is to design a simple GUI that navigates through NYU's class/courses page and show all the class information that they want. Then, users will select the classes that they want and every single possible combination of the classes (that don't have time conflicts and include all classes) will be shown. Future modifications include adding specific professors that you want, excluding some hours (such as lunchtime), or allowing waitlist classes to be included.
