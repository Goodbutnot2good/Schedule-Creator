# **Schedule-Creator**

## ABOUT

This project is written in Python with the help of the [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) library and python 3.0's built in [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) library. The goal of this project is to design a simple GUI that navigates through NYU's class/courses page and shows all the class information. Users will be able to select their classes and be able to see every single possible combination of their schedules that satisfies credit requirements. Planned goals include selecting specific professors or reducing the time period allowed for classes (such as no classes before 9am or after 6pm).
